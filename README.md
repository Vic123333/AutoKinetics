# AutoKinetics
KineSim is a hybrid Python/C++ framework for chemical kinetics. It calculates rate constants using collision theory, Arrhenius, and transition state theory, simulates complex reaction networks with stiff ODE solvers, and applies automatic quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA) for model reduction.
